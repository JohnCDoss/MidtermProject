# MMA Round Timer UX Problem

In MMA, the round timer is crucial for fighters, coaches, referees, and fans. However, its current implementation presents several UX issues:

- **Limited Visibility for Fighters**  
  Fighters often canâ€™t see the round timer while grappling or striking, especially when their view is blocked by the cage, the opponent, or poor screen placement.

- **Inconsistent Audio Cues**  
  Corners rely on shouting or clapping to warn their fighter about remaining time, which can be ineffective in loud arenas.

- **TV and Arena Timer Mismatch**  
  Broadcasts may show a slightly delayed or desynced timer, leading to confusion for commentators and fans. Arena spectators also sometimes lack a clear view of how much time is left.

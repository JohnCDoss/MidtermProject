## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Solution

### 1. Cage-Embedded Digital Timer  
Install small, unobtrusive LED timers into the top edges of the cage or near the neutral corners. These would:

- Remain visible to fighters during stand-up and ground positions.
- Be dim or off until the final 30 seconds, then brighten subtly.

### 2. Haptic Feedback for Fighters  
Use lightweight, wearable tech (like ankle or wrist bands) to give fighters **non-intrusive vibrations** at the 30-second and 10-second marks. Benefits include:

- Doesn‚Äôt rely on vision or hearing.  
- Keeps fighters aware of time without distracting them.  

### 3. Improved In-Arena Timer Displays  
Add large digital timers in multiple areas of the arena so:

- Coaches and spectators always know how much time remains.  
- Timekeeping becomes standardized across all promotions.

### 4. Broadcast Timer Sync  
Ensure the on-screen clock used in TV broadcasts is pulled **directly from the official fight timer** with no delay or manual input. Use graphics that highlight the final seconds for added clarity.
